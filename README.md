# A prestyled, zero-config, single-line component library integrated with react-hook-form and Zod

## Getting started

1. Create your form's validation schema (we use and advocate for [Zod](https://zod.dev/))
2. Initialize [react-hook-form](https://react-hook-form.com/) with your validation schema using [@hookform/resolvers](https://github.com/react-hook-form/resolvers#zod)
3. Pass your react-hook-form object into [Onigiri UI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/onigiri-ui) component

And... Magic!

## Motivation

Popular component libraries out there ([MUI](https://mui.com/), [daisyUI](https://daisyui.com/), or [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/)) provide some form of states that you can readily implement in your state management. This provides a very high degree of implementation flexibility to front-end engineers.

Not every engineer need that level of flexibility.
